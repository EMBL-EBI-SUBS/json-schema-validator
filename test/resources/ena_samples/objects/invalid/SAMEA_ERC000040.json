      "value" : "Samples were in form of 3ml biomass pellet with high salt concentration(6 g/L) that had been used as anode material of flate plate plant microbial fuel cell(plant-MFC). The biomass pellets were either marine sediment only, a mixture of marine sediment with activated carbon or both combination with plant roots. First, The flat plate MFC reactors were operated without plants for 160 days (21 October 2016 until 4 April 2017).On day 160, plants (Spartina anglica) were transplanted into the anode of the flat plate MFC. Therefore, the systems were called plant-MFC. The plant-MFCs were operated for 190 days (4 April 2017 until 10 October 2017).After 190 day operation with plants(10 October 2017), the biomass samples were collected for the DNA extraction. The samples were stored immediately in -80 centigrade freezer after collection before the DNA sequencing was performed. Common cordgrass (Spartina anglica) and the marine sediment were collected from a tidal area wetland at Krabbendijke, The Netherlands (51.446710N, 4.093149E). Sediment was collected on 20 May 2016. The plants were collected on 5 March 2017. The utilized AC is granular activated carbon PK 1-3(Cabot Norit Netherlands BV, with apparent density of 290 g/L)"
